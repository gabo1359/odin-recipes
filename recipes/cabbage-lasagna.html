    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>A very  filling, low-carb lasagna that uses cabbage leaves in place of lasagna noodles. 
        We find it every bit as good if not better than lasagna with pasta</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>½ cup grated carrots</li>
        <li>4 ounces mushroom pieces</li>
        <li>1 pound canned tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried basil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon thyme</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon nutmeg</li>
        <li>1 head cabbage</li>
        <li>24 ounces low-fat cottage cheese</li>
        <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon parsley</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon oregano</li>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>2 cups grated part-skim mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef, onion, and garlic 
            in the hot skillet until meat is browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease. 
            Add carrots and mushrooms. Add tomatoes and break up using a fork. Add basil, sugar, 
            1 teaspoon salt, thyme, and nutmeg. Reduce heat and simmer meat sauce for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil. Immerse cabbage in the boiling water</li>
        <li>Combine cottage cheese, 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, parsley, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, 
            and oregano in a bowl and set aside.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat a 9x13-inch baking pan with cooking 
            spray and place a layer of cooked cabbage leaves flat in the bottom.</li>
        <li>Reserve 1/4 cup of meat sauce. Layer 1/2 the remaining sauce on top of the cabbage leaves in 
            the baking pan. Layer 1/2 the cottage cheese mixture followed by 1/2 the mozzarella cheese. 
            Add a second layer of cabbage leaves, followed by remaining 1/2 of meat sauce, remaining 
            cottage cheese mixture, and mozzarella cheese. Sprinkle reserved 1/4 cup meat sauce on top 
            and finish with 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Remove from the oven and let sit 15 minutes before slicing.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Cook's Note: </strong><em>This can be made ahead and refrigerated. Allow an additional 
        10 to 15 minutes baking time.</em></p>
