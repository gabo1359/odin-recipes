    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>A delicious, unique way to prepare a wonderful fillet of salmon! People who think they 
        don't like salmon may have something different to say about it after they try this oven-fried version!</p>
        
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup bread crumbs</li>
        <li>Â½ cup Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried parsley</li>
        <li>2 pounds salmon fillets</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Pat salmon fillets dry with paper towels.</li>
        <li>Mix olive oil, garlic, and salt together in a bowl. Let stand 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Combine bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, and dried parsley in a medium bowl.</li>
        <li>Coat salmon on all sides with olive oil mixture using a pastry brush. Press salmon 
            into the bread crumb mixture to coat on all sides. Place on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until salmon flakes easily with a fork, about 10 minutes per 
            inch at the thickest part of the salmon.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Cook's Note: </strong><em>Fine dried bread crumbs work best for this recipe, but if you 
        prefer, you can use panko bread crumbs instead. Lightly oil them before mixing with cheese 
        and parsley, then broil the salmon for the last minute or two to brown the crumbs up.</em></p>
